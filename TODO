- do LSPG with sample mesh Kokkos
- add checks, e.g. num of basis cannot be larger than dofs, etc.
- kokkos do FOM with bdf1 ?


MS problem:
(a) eigen, fom, rk4	: done, ok, convergence is as expected
(b) eigen, fom, bdf1	: done, ok, convergence is as expected and errors are better than rk4
(c) kokkos, fom, rk4	: done, ok, matches eigen rk4 exactly (serial mac)
(d) kokkos, fom, bdf1	: missing

ABCCHEM problem:
(a) eigen, fom, rk4	: done
(b) eigen, fom, bdf1	: done
(c) kokkos, fom, rk4	: done
(d) kokkos, fom, bdf1	: missing


Notes:
- to solve the FOM with bdf1 the jacobian is a square sparse matrix.
In Eigen, it seems to be a good choice to use bicgstab.

- to do LSPG, we opt for using the normal equations.
This is because we don;t have QR for Kokkos yet.
We need to find something that works for both Eigen and Kokkos.
Just for consistency.


Recall that:
2^5  = 32
2^6  = 64
2^7  = 128
2^8  = 256
2^9  = 512
2^10 = 1024
2^11 = 2048
2^12 = 4096

but for chemistry problem, we a squared mesh with 3 dofs per cell such that:
tag: a  Nx = 2^6  => 4,096	cells => 12,288     dofs
tag: b  Nx = 2^7  => 16,384     cells => 49,152     dofs
tag: c  Nx = 2^8  => 65,536     cells => 196,608    dofs
tag: d  Nx = 2^9  => 262,144    cells => 786,432    dofs
tag: e  Nx = 2^10 => 1,048,576  cells => 3,145,728  dofs
tag: f  Nx = 2^11 => 4,194,304  cells => 12,582,912 dofs
tag: g  Nx = 2^12 => 16,777,216 cells => 50,331,648 dofs

Sets of cases for chemistry:
(a) meshes = {a,b,c,d}
